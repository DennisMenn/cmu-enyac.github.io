    "content": "<p>Barbara Lazarus advocated for graduate students and young faculty, a quality that Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Diana Marculescu boldly displays. She has advised and mentored 61 graduate students. Through mentoring, she hopes to empower her mentees to define their path as professionals and researchers. Marculescu, as the Founding Director of the <a href=\"https://engineering.cmu.edu/faculty-staff/professional-development/center-faculty-success/index.html\">College of Engineeringâ€™s Center for Faculty Success</a>, also supports junior faculty. The center organizes events from orientations to mixers to workshops. Notable among the events is the Bias Buster series. These sessions focus on raising awareness of and reducing unconscious bias to create a diverse and inclusive community among faculty, staff, and students. The idea for creating the center arose out of a retreat Marculescu attended in 2014. The faculty who participated in the CIT Women Faculty Retreat agreed on the structure of the center, in that it should provide support to all faculty. Through collaboration, the center gained endorsement by the College and has since developed to provide faculty resources.</p>"
